  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior Pugofer process.

The following commands are available:
\\{inferior-pugofer-mode-map}

A Pugofer process can be fired up with M-x run-pugofer.

Customisation: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on comint-mode-hook and
inferior-pugofer-mode-hook (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior Pugofer process from other buffers containing
Pugofer source.  
    switch-to-pugofer switches the current buffer to the Pugofer process buffer.
    pugofer-send-definition sends the current definition to the Pugofer process.
    pugofer-compile-definition compiles the current definition.
    pugofer-send-region sends the current region to the Pugofer process.
    pugofer-compile-region compiles the current region.

    pugofer-send-definition-and-go, pugofer-compile-definition-and-go,
        pugofer-send-region-and-go, and pugofer-compile-region-and-go
        switch to the Pugofer process buffer after sending their text.
For information on running multiple processes in multiple buffers, see
documentation for variable pugofer-buffer.

Commands:
Return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
Return before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Tab indents for Pugofer; with argument, shifts rest
    of expression rigidly with the current line.
C-M-q does Tab on each line starting within following expression.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.  Semicolons start comments.
If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]

MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT
===========================================================================
pugofer.el supports, in a fairly simple fashion, running multiple Pugofer
processes. To run multiple Pugofer processes, you start the first up with
\\[run-pugofer]. It will be in a buffer named *pugofer*. Rename this buffer
with \\[rename-buffer]. You may now start up a new process with another
\\[run-pugofer]. It will be in a new buffer, named *pugofer*. You can
switch between the different process buffers with \\[switch-to-buffer].

Commands that send text from source buffers to Pugofer processes --
like pugofer-send-definition or pugofer-compile-region -- have to choose a
process to send to, when you have more than one Pugofer process around. This
is determined by the global variable pugofer-buffer. Suppose you
have three inferior Pugofers running:
    Buffer	Process
    foo		pugofer
    bar		pugofer<2>
    *pugofer*    pugofer<3>
If you do a \\[pugofer-send-definition-and-go] command on some Pugofer source
code, what process do you send it to?

- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *pugofer*), 
  you send it to that process.
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you
  send it to the process attached to buffer pugofer-buffer.
This process selection is performed by function pugofer-proc.

Whenever \\[run-pugofer] fires up a new process, it resets pugofer-buffer
to be the new process's buffer. If you only run one process, this will
do the right thing. If you run multiple processes, you can change
pugofer-buffer to another process buffer with \\[set-variable].

More sophisticated approaches are, of course, possible. If you find yourself
needing to switch back and forth between multiple processes frequently,
you may wish to consider ilisp.el, a larger, more sophisticated package
for running inferior Lisp and Pugofer processes. The approach taken here is
for a minimal, simple implementation. Feel free to extend it.")

;;; ===========================================================================
;;; 8/88 Olin
;;; Created. 
;;;
;;; 2/15/89 Olin
;;; Removed -emacs flag from process invocation. It's only useful for
;;; cpugofer, and makes cpugofer assume it's running under xpugofer.el,
;;; which messes things up royally. A bug.
;;;
;;; 5/22/90 Olin
;;; - Upgraded to use comint-send-string and comint-send-region.
;;; - run-pugofer now offers to let you edit the command line if
;;;   you invoke it with a prefix-arg. M-x pugofer is redundant, and
;;;   has been removed.
;;; - Explicit references to process "pugofer" have been replaced with
;;;   (pugofer-proc). This allows better handling of multiple process bufs.
;;; - Added pugofer-send-last-sexp, bound to C-x C-e. A gnu convention.
;;; - Have not added process query facility a la cmulisp.el's lisp-show-arglist
;;;   and friends, but interested hackers might find a useful application
;;;   of this facility.
;;;
;;; 3/12/90 Olin
;;; - pugofer-load-file and pugofer-compile-file no longer switch-to-pugofer.
;;;   Tale suggested this.

;;; Around 1993 Rusi
;;; munged together scheme.el and cmuscheme.el
;;; Changed scheme to pugofer and did the minimum to get it 
;;; to work for pugofer

;;; 5 Sept 2015
;;; Changed some defvars to defcustoms
